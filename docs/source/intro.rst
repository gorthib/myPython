Preface

Python is a programming buzzword across all IT companies and it has become a key requirement for any job. 
Over the past 8+ years Python has grown in multiple directions and I have seen often engineers get confused which one to choose. 
There is so much documentation avaialable on the interenet, but it is always a challenge which one to choose or where to start. 
I have come across many engineers who are familiar with basic shell or perl programming, but no idea how to proceed. 
My goal is here is to give some basic knowledge of Python and some programming concepts making you to explore further.

Python is really an amazing language and in fact, easy to learn. 
There are multiple ways, you can achieve the target writing python scripts. 
I want to introduce some simple and straight forward approaches for any day-to-day programming needs. 
My primary goal is to introduce you to basic concepts with some details, but in in depth.
